# FerrisChat
Chat in a 2D virtual space where every client is represented with a crab.

[Try it here!](https://jamesfator.com/ferris_chat/)

*Overview:*
* Heavily based on early roguelike development (See *Resources* below).
* Map and entities on map are autogenerated.
* Server uses ECS (specs) to store and process the entities in the world.
* Clients are written with Rust wasm (stdweb) and connect to server with small Javascript shim.
* Server serializes the ECS via serde then sends it to clients using WebSockets (tungstenite).
* Clients send their input back to the server for their updates to be broadcast out to other clients.
